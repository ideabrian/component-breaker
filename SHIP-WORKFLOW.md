# 🍄 Mario Jump Button Ship Workflow v3.0

A comprehensive shipping orchestrator that maintains high velocity while ensuring project oversight through subagent automation.

## 🎯 Philosophy: Mario Jump Button

- **Ship NOW**, perfect later
- **Real users** > theoretical perfection  
- **Working demo** > comprehensive documentation
- **5-minute deploy** > 5-hour optimization
- **Feedback-driven improvement** > assumption-driven development

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

The `/ship` command orchestrates 5 specialized agents:

### 1. 📝 Documentation Agent
- Records completed work in `.mario-status.json`
- Maintains shipping history (last 10 ships)
- Tracks files changed and deployment readiness

### 2. 🚀 Git Automation Agent  
- Automatically stages all changes
- Creates descriptive commit messages
- Pushes to main branch
- Handles empty change scenarios gracefully

### 3. 🚢 Deployment Agent
- Builds the project (`npm run build`)
- Deploys frontend via Cloudflare Pages (git-triggered)
- Deploys Cloudflare Worker API if present
- Continues on partial deployment failures

### 4. 🔍 Project Analysis Agent
- Assesses overall project health (scoring system)
- Identifies quick wins and technical debt
- Analyzes current capabilities and gaps
- Generates actionable insights

### 5. 🎯 Strategic Roadmap Agent
- Updates `NextMoves.md` with fresh analysis
- Prioritizes tasks by impact/effort matrix
- Provides time-boxed recommendations
- Maintains strategic continuity

## 🎮 Usage Options

### Command Line
```bash
# Ship with default message
./ship

# Ship with custom description
./ship "Added dark mode toggle and improved accessibility"

# Via npm scripts
npm run ship
npm run ship-with "Custom message here"
```

### Manual Node Execution
```bash
node mario-ship.js "Completed user authentication system"
```

## 📊 Output & Monitoring

### Live URLs Generated
- **Frontend**: https://component-breaker.pages.dev
- **API**: https://component-breaker-api.workers.dev

### Status Tracking
All shipping attempts logged in `.mario-status.json`:
```json
{
  "lastShipped": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-02T...",
    "work": "Added component analysis features",
    "files_changed": ["src/App.tsx", "src/components/..."],
    "commit_ready": true
  },
  "shippingHistory": [...]
}
```

### Strategic Updates
`NextMoves.md` automatically updated with:
- Current state assessment
- Project health score
- Prioritized task matrix (Ship Next → Future Vision)
- Time-boxed recommendations
- Quick wins identification

## 🛠️ Subagent Architecture

### Health Assessment Algorithm
- **Base Score**: 85/100
- **Build Success**: +0 / -15 points
- **TypeScript Config**: +5 points
- **Test Coverage**: +10 points (when present)
- **Documentation**: +5 points (when comprehensive)

### Priority Matrix
1. **🚀 Ship Next**: High Impact, Low Effort (30-min tasks)
2. **🔧 Improve Current**: Medium Impact, Low Effort (2-hour tasks)  
3. **📈 Scale & Optimize**: High Impact, Medium Effort (weekly projects)
4. **🎯 Future Vision**: High Impact, High Effort (monthly initiatives)

### Quick Wins Detection
Automatically identifies:
- Missing README files
- Lack of loading states
- Missing copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Accessibility improvements needed
- UI polish opportunities

## 🔧 Error Handling & Recovery

### Graceful Degradation
- Git failures don't stop deployment
- Deployment failures don't stop analysis
- Partial shipping still updates strategic roadmap

### Status Reporting
Each agent reports success/failure independently:
```
📝 Documentation: ✅
🚀 Git Commit: ✅
🚢 Deployment: ❌ (continues anyway)
🔍 Analysis: ✅
🎯 NextMoves: ✅
```

## 🎯 Integration Points

### Cloudflare Integration
- Pages auto-deploys from git pushes
- Worker deployment via wrangler CLI
- Environment-specific configurations respected

### Development Workflow
- Integrates with existing npm scripts
- Respects TypeScript/ESLint configurations
- Maintains existing project structure

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Deployment status via Cloudflare Dashboard
- User feedback collection ready
- Performance monitoring hookups prepared

## 🍄 Mario's Shipping Principles

1. **Ship First, Optimize Second**: Get working software to users quickly
2. **Feedback Over Features**: Real user input trumps assumed needs
3. **Iteration Over Perfection**: 10 small improvements > 1 perfect feature
4. **Velocity Over Velocity**: Sustainable speed with strategic direction
5. **Users Over Code**: Shipping value matters more than elegant architecture

*"It's-a me! Mario! Ship fast, iterate faster!" 🍄*

## 🚀 Next Steps After Shipping

1. **Monitor Deployment**: Check Cloudflare Dashboard for deployment status
2. **Review NextMoves.md**: Check updated strategic priorities  
3. **Collect Feedback**: Engage with users and gather insights
4. **Plan Next Ship**: Use 30-minute rule for next quick win
5. **Iterate Based on Data**: Let real usage drive next priorities
