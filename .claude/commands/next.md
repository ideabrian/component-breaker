# ðŸŽ¯ Next Moves Analysis

Analyze the current project state and show the most important next steps.

## Your Task

1. **Read the current NextMoves.md** if it exists
2. **Analyze project status** - what's been accomplished, what's pending
3. **Show top 3-5 immediate priorities** from the "Ship Next" category
4. **Provide specific next actions** - exactly what to work on in the next 30-60 minutes

Focus on high-impact, low-effort items that maintain momentum.
